Wanderlust – DevOps Implementation
📌 About This Application

Wanderlust is a full-stack MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js) application designed for managing and exploring travel destinations, user bookings, and reviews. The app provides both a frontend (React) for users and a backend (Node/Express + MongoDB) for API services.

👨‍💻 My Role in This Project

I am leveraging this application to demonstrate modern DevOps practices in a real-world scenario.
My work on this project focuses on:

🐳 Containerization with Docker

🔄 End-to-End CI/CD pipelines (GitHub Actions / Jenkins / Azure DevOps)

☁️ Cloud-Native Deployment strategies

📊 Automation & Monitoring for reliability

This project is an excellent foundation for implementing DevOps workflows, and I am using it to showcase production-grade DevOps skills rather than application development.

⚠️ Important Note

The application codebase was originally created by another contributor (source: wanderlust repo).
I am using it to design, implement, and optimize DevOps pipelines and deployment workflows, ensuring it follows industry best practices.
