# 🌍 Wanderlust Application – DevOps Project  

## 📌 About This Application  
**Wanderlust** is a full-stack **MERN (MongoDB, Express, React, Node.js)** application built for exploring and managing travel destinations, bookings, and reviews.  

- **Frontend** → React (user interface)  
- **Backend** → Node.js + Express (API services)  
- **Database** → MongoDB  

This project provides a complete real-world application setup, making it an excellent foundation for implementing **DevOps workflows and cloud-native practices**.

## My Role in This Project  
I am **not the original developer** of this app. Instead, I am leveraging this project as a real-world case study for DevOps practices.My work focuses on implementing production-grade DevOps workflows, including:

- 🐳 **Containerization** → Dockerizing the full-stack application  
- 🔄 **CI/CD Pipelines** → GitHub Actions / Jenkins / Azure DevOps  
- ☁️ **Cloud Deployment** → Deploying to cloud platforms (AWS, Azure, GCP)  
- 📊 **Automation & Monitoring** → Ensuring scalability, reliability & observability  

This project demonstrates **production-grade DevOps practices**—focusing on infrastructure, automation, and deployment pipelines rather than application development.
